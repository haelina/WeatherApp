## Known Bugs

- All the colours don't work correctly when android phone has darkmode on. I ran out of time trying to fix these.
- When getting the phone's gps coordinates they are a bit inaccurate even though I have used fine location to get these. The weather data that I got using current location is about 1-2 kilometers away from my location.
